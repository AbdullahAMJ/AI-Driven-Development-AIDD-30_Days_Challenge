# AIDD — Task 2 (Official Submission)

## Part A — Theory (In My Own Words)

---

### **1. Nine Pillars Understanding**

#### (a) Why using AI Development Agents for repetitive setup tasks helps me grow as a system architect

When I let AI agents handle repetitive setup tasks like project initialization, folders, configs, or boilerplates, I free up my time and energy for real architectural thinking. Instead of spending effort on steps that don’t develop my skills, I can focus on system structure, logic, flows, and planning. AI tools act like assistants, helping me practice system-level thinking rather than manual work.

#### (b) How the Nine Pillars help a developer become an M-Shaped Developer

The Nine Pillars cover testing, specs, AI agents, CLIs, workflows, and reasoning all working together.  
By using them daily, I naturally learn several interconnected skills at the same time: architecture, testing, automation, planning, prompting, and debugging.  
This creates deep expertise in multiple fields, which is exactly what defines an M-Shaped Developer.

### **2. Vibe Coding vs Spec-Driven Development**

#### (a) Why Vibe Coding creates problems after one week

Vibe Coding feels fast at the start, but becomes messy very quickly.  
There are no clear specs, no structure, and no reference for future updates.  
After one week, I forget why I wrote certain logic, and AI agents also struggle because nothing is documented.  
This makes the project harder to extend or fix.

#### (b) How Specification-Driven Development prevents those problems

SDD forces me to write the intent clearly before coding.  
The specification works like a map for me and for AI.  
Because the goal is written first, the code stays clean, predictable and easier to modify in the future.  
This removes confusion and prevents long-term messiness.

### **3. Architecture Thinking**

#### (a) How architecture-first thinking changes a developer’s role

Architecture-first thinking shifts me from being just a code writer to being a system designer.  
Instead of focusing on syntax, I think about how components should interact, how AI agents should work and how the whole system should function.  
My role becomes guiding the AI instead of doing everything manually.

#### (b) Why developers must think in layers instead of raw code

Modern AI-driven software is built using multiple layers:  
models, APIs, agents, workflows, logic, and evaluation.  
If I focus only on raw code, I miss the bigger picture.  
Thinking in layers helps me separate responsibilities, scale the system, and use AI effectively.

# Part B — Practical Task 

## **1️⃣ Exact CLI Prompt Used**

generate a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function. It must include “@”, a valid domain like .com or .org, and it should return clear error messages.

# Part C — MCQs


1️⃣ What is the main purpose of Spec-Driven Development?
a) Make coding faster
**b) Clear requirements before coding begins ✅**
c) Remove developers
d) Avoid documentation

2️⃣ What is the biggest mindset shift in AI-Driven Development?
a) Writing more code manually
**b) Thinking in systems and clear instructions ✅**
c) Memorizing more syntax
d) Working without any tools

3️⃣ Biggest failure of Vibe Coding?
a) AI stops responding
**b) Architecture becomes hard to extend ✅**
c) Code runs slow
d) Fewer comments written

4️⃣ Main advantage of using AI CLI agents?
a) They replace the developer completely
**b) Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving ✅**
c) Make coding faster but less reliable
d) Make coding optional

5️⃣ What defines an M-Shaped Developer?
a) Knows little about everything
b) Deep in only one field
**c) Deep skills in multiple related domains ✅**
d) Works without AI tools

## 📝 Reflection

This task helped me understand that modern development is not about typing code fast — it’s about thinking clearly.
SDD and the Nine Pillars teach me to plan before building, and AI agents support me like assistants.
The future belongs to developers who think in systems, write clear instructions, and collaborate with AI effectively.
